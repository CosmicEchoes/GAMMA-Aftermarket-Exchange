# The Aftermarket Exchange
The Aftermarket Exchange is a mod that allows players to exchange their weapons for "upgraded" counterparts, with each faction having unique sets of weapons to modify.

Big thanks to Grok for providing the modpack to work off of for this project, Darkasleif for being a massive help with debugging weird scripting errors and providing code to learn and work off of, and arti for providing code to learn from with the WPO.

# Features

Faction mechanics now have the option to take a weapon that you own and upgrade it to an alternative variant with more features and capabilities, for fee of course. Weapons that you receive from the exchange will have the same comparable durability as the gun offered, so make sure that you give mechanics something decent to work with.

Each faction's mechanics will have a set amount of weapons specified in the following list, though the player is not limited to just their faction's mechanics.
If you are able to speak with a mechanic, they will offer their services.

# Installation
